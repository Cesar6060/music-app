# Music Note Recognition App

A web-based application inspired by SoundGym, designed to train and enhance the listening skills of music producers, audio engineers, and musicians through an engaging game-like environment. Users can listen to musical notes and test their ability to identify them accurately, improving their music note recognition abilities.

## Sprint 1: Core Functionality

In this phase, our primary goal is to develop the basic functionality that allows users to interact with the application. This includes creating a simple user interface for note playback, providing selectable answer choices, and giving immediate feedback on answer selection.

### Core Features

- **Note Generation:** Generate and play a random musical note from a predefined range.
- **User Interface (UI):** A simple interface to listen to the note and choose the answer from multiple options.
- **Answer Validation:** Logic to check the correctness of the user's selection and provide feedback.
- **Repeat Functionality:** Ability to replay the note before submitting an answer.
